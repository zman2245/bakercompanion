        <item>It is best to take the butter out of the fridge and let it sit for an hour before use. Alternatively, you can microwave for 10 seconds at a time. Be careful to avoid melting. You only want the butter softened for easy mixing, not cooked!</item>

        <item>The goal is to cook the butter until you see the separated milk solids turn brown. Watch closely to make sure you don’t burn it.

In a medium sauce pan, melt the butter slowly over low heat.

Once the butter is liquified, turn the heat up to medium. You\’ll notice the butter going through stages. It will start crackling and popping. After 5-7 minutes, a foam will form on top - watch closely because it\’s almost done! With a spatula or spoon, gently stir the butter and watch for brown residue (the milk solids).

Once you start seeing brown, you will also notice a nutty smell - take the pan off the heat, stir for a few more seconds, and transfer to a heat-safe bowl.</item>

        <item>As a rule of thumb, if the vanilla is in something going into the oven, like a cake or pie, you can use artificial vanilla. Even professional bakers and taste-testers can\'t tell the difference. But if you are making something, like a buttercream frosting, that is being mixed together and then served, you must use the real thing.</item>

        <item>Carefully remove the cake from the oven. Test it by sticking a Toothpick into the center and pulling it out. If it comes out clean or with just a few crumbs stuck to the side, the cake is done. If there\’s batter on the toothpick, cook longer. Try Baking/Testing in 2-5 minute increments until the cake is done.</item>
